# Titanic-EDA
 In this project, I explored the Titanic dataset to see how factors like age, class, and family size affected passenger survival rates. By doing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I found patterns that show which factors influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.
In this project, I explored the Titanic dataset to see how factors like age, class, and family size affected passenger survival rates. By doing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I found patterns that show which factors influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.

My goal was to understand how different attributes impacted who survived. I looked at passenger age, ticket class, and family size to find out which groups were more likely to survive and why. Using visualizations and statistical tools helped make these patterns clear and easy to understand.

Through this analysis, I identified key trends and gained a deeper understanding of the social dynamics during the tragedy. This helps us see the human stories behind the data, giving us a better understanding of the factors that shaped passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.
